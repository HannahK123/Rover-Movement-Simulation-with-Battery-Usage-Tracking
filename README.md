# Rover-Movement-Simulation-with-Battery-Usage-Tracking
This Python program calculates the movement of a rover based on user-input angle and time. It computes the total distance traveled, horizontal and vertical displacements, battery usage, and remaining battery. It checks if the rover can reach its destination and return based on battery levels and movement distance.
